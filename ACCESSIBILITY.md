dotbydot is an accessible, educational web platform designed to help users master Braille through a series of progressive courses. Built with Next.js and React using the App Router, the website emphasizes high accessibility standards to support blind users and those relying on assistive technologies. Inspired by platforms like Duolingo and Khan Academy, dotbydot aims to offer a friendly, kind, and effective learning environment.
